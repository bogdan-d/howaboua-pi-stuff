# Howaboua Pi Stuff

The Pi extensions and skills I use to keep long agent sessions useful without building a fake operating system around them.

Everything is published as a separate npm package. Install a bundle for the full setup, or pick only what you need. Revolutionary stuff. A table.

Pi packages run with your local permissions. You can obviously trust me, a stranger on the internet with a folder called `pi-stuff`, but read the source before installing it anyway.

## Bundles

| Package | Includes | Deliberate exclusions |
|---|---|---|
| [`@howaboua/pi-stuff`](./packages/pi-stuff) | 11 general extensions and 8 shareable skills | Codex conversion and Omarchy support |
| [`@howaboua/pi-extensions`](./packages/pi-extensions) | 11 general extensions | Codex conversion |
| [`@howaboua/pi-skills`](./packages/pi-skills) | 8 shareable skills | Omarchy support |

```bash
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-stuff
# or
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-extensions
pi install npm:@howaboua/pi-skills
```

`pi-codex-conversion` is separate because it changes Pi's tool surface for GPT/Codex models. `omarchy-help` is separate because it targets Arch desktops configured with Omarchy.

Pi discovers installed skills automatically and loads them when a task matches. Use `/skill:<name>` when you want to invoke one explicitly.

## How I use it

Map an unfamiliar repo, set `/marker` once the useful context is in place, implement one coherent change, and run `/review`. After triage and QA, `/end` carries the accepted result forward. Broad changes get an `agent-native-hardening` pass.

For UI work, I give the agent references first—apps, screenshots, and interface details I like—then iterate through browser inspection and screenshots. One-shotting a good frontend is mostly a party trick.
